            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The PREY pluckt out of the Mouth of the LION. OR, An account of ſome paſſages of Providence concerning <hi>THOMAS SAWDIE,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>N the 29th. of <hi>June</hi> 1663, there being a Fair then at <hi>Lawraek,</hi> this Boy went to the Fair in the preſence of his Mother and ſome others. By the way he was very importunate with his Mother for money (though he had ſome ſmall pieces in his pocket given him by his Maſter to buy him a Fairing:) His Mother not being well ſtored, did deny him. The boy having ſeen ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and bought ſome toyes in the Fair, towards the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing returned homewards in good ſeaſon, to manage ſome neceſſary imployments that were incumbent on him as his charge.</p>
            <p>In a Field, as he was on his way alone, not far from his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters houſe, there met him the appearance of a Woman very gawdy, all in white: who asked him, whether he wanted any money whether he would have any money reaching out mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to him with her hand. The Boy refuſed it. On this the <hi>Spectrum</hi> or appearance vaniſhed away, ruſhing by him with ſome muttering, diſcontented words, which he did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, and ſuddenly a great Black Dog, with very great and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:35731:3"/>fiery eyes ſtood before him; on which he fel to the ground as dead, but when he recovered, and roſe up, he ſaw nothing.</p>
            <p>After this he went home, and followed his buſineſs; but that night lying with his Fellow-ſervant he reſted very unqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly, and there appeared to him again the former <hi>Spectrum</hi> in the ſhape, or likeneſs of a great black Dog, which charged him, that he ſhould not diſcover any thing that he had ſeen, and that he would come again to him the next night.</p>
            <p>The ſecond night, when his Bed-fellow was aſleep, it came again, and ſtood by his bed-ſide, as before; made him ſome tempting proffers, and went off. And the Boy confeſſeth, that he was not then afraid, though he heard the voice of a man out of the mouth of a Dog.</p>
            <p>The third night it came as formerly; as asked him whether he would have any money? and the money tendred was eight pieces, as great as pieces of Eight, very ſpecious, which were given hm, and received by him, on this condition, that he ſhouly come to it neer the Bakes-Park-Gate (which was neer his Maſters houſe) on the Lords Day in the afternoon (which is called the Ugly Day) which was to be the Evening before the next Fair, to be held at <hi>Lawrack</hi>'s, eight weeks diſtant from the former: To which Fair he ſhould be carryed, and have all his deſires.</p>
            <p>Now the Boy was charged, when he received the money in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his hand, and laid it on a Cheſt by him, that the next day he ſhould lay it up in the Cheſt, and naile it faſt, and not make it known. But the next morning the money was gone from the top of the Cheſt, where he laid it. However he was promiſed afterwards that he ſhould have money enough, if he would come into the Field called the Bakes-Park, at the time and place appointed.</p>
            <p>On this the Boy fell ſick, ſwelling in his ſtomack and belly, and almoſt totally loſt his appetite to meat. In which manner he continued for a Fortnights ſpace: then the ſwelling ſtruck up into his neck and throat, moſt thinking that it was an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtume: ſome that it was wormes; but the apparition told the Boy that this was not ſickneſs, but it was only to deceive
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:35731:3"/>the people, that they might not ſuſpect any other thing by him.</p>
            <p>This diſtemper increaſing on him, his Maſter ſent to one Mr. <hi>Cary</hi> a Phyſician at <hi>Lyskerd;</hi> who when he poured his Water into an Urinal, ſaid, he could not diſcern any thing by the Water, for that it was very full of black duſt, and as it were rags of Brown Paper; and told thoſe that brought it, they ſhould go home again, and take his Water, and put it into a cleaner Veſſel; which being done, (though the Veſſel was clean enough before) and brought to him again; he found it even as at firſt; and then he ſaid it was bewitched. However he ſent him a Julep, a Plaiſter, and a Cordial of Alchermes, with ſome other things: But the Boy grew worſe, and worſe, and fell into ſeveral ſorts of Fits.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Like Epileptick Fits (or of the Falling Sickneſs) and in theſe he would continue for the ſpace of ſeven or eight hours. After this the ſwelling in his throat went off, but that in his belly continued.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Like Convulſion Fits; and he had forty or fifty, yea more in a day; and in theſe he continued for a Fortnight, or longer: In which Fits he would tear off his hair from his head, bite his own fleſh, or any others, or whatever he could faſten on. His Maſter and his Relations on this applyed themſelves to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers perſons for the cure of theſe Fits, could find no remedy.</p>
            <p>Hereupon an Uncle to the Boy, who held an Eſtate, wherein his life was of main concernment, took him and carryed him to one <hi>Condy</hi>'s of <hi>Stoke-Climſland</hi> in the ſaid County, who ſaid, that the Boy was overlookt. He gave him a Plaiſter, a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and a little Bag to hang about his neck, and doubted not to cure him.</p>
            <p>The ſecond time his Relations went, this <hi>Condy</hi> gave them only a Powder, but did promiſe them moſt certainly to cure him. The third time that they applyed themſelves to this <hi>Condy,</hi> they did moſt earneſtly intreat him to ſhew them ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more, what the diſtemper was, (ſeeing the Boy was ſo unruly, and taken ſo ſtrangely) he charged them to watch him carefully, and not to let him be out of their ſight, leaſt he were taken away: For that on their neglect ſo he would be, and they
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:35731:4"/>ſhould never find him, but dead by ſome hedge or old wall. He charged them to come to him again, but they went no morre.</p>
            <p>The very next day after this the Boy would have run away to the place appointed for meeting, but was caught hold of, and brought back again.</p>
            <p>That night the Family being at Religious Duties, both reading and praying, he began to hollow like a Hunter, to roar, and whiſtle, to make diſturbance, till his ſpirits were quite ſpent; and ſo fell into a deep ſleep, from two hours in the night till ſeven next morning: In which time they could not perceive whether he were alive or dead, but only by his heat. His Arms were ſpread abroad, and ſuch a ſtiffneſs ſeized on them, with his legs, and other parts, that there was no bending of them, without breaking them. Thus he continued for three nights, beginning after the firſt night about midnight, and ſo lying till ſeven or eight in the morning. In all this time ſince his fits began, the food he received was very inconſiderable. After this for three days following in the morning, lying in his bed as dead, he was taken out, and thrown with violence under it, his arms all abroad, his limbs inflexible as before, yet none of the bed-clothes were removed, and this as ſoon as the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that watched by him were come down the ſtairs.</p>
            <p>The third morning, when the Boy was put into bed, and came to himſelf, his Mother (who then watched by him) was very earneſt in preſſing him to make ſome diſcovery, whether he had ſeen any evill thing, and whether in diſcourſe he had made any promiſe, or what he had done. The Boy was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly unwilling, but (being urged far) at laſt he confeſſed, that he had ſeen, as before is related, and that he had promiſed to go with that which appeared to him.</p>
            <p>On this diſcovery he fell into very ſtrange motions of his body, like one ringing of Bels, lifting up his hands and feet for five hours at leaſt, (as he lay on the ground) though even then appearing to be ſenſeleſs, and not able to ſpeak a word, yet would make ſtrange noiſes, which were heard at a great diſtance. Sometimes he would neigh like a Stone-horſe, then would ſing certain ſtrange Muſical Notes and Tunes; which
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:35731:4"/>having done, he would ſcratch, tear, and bite thoſe that held him.</p>
            <p>Now after he had made this diſcovery as before, the Devil did appear to him in the ſhape of a little man, with long fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and great eyes, clad all in black, and that uſually like Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet, and threatning him with his fiſt: On this, ever at the nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God, he would fall down dead. When the Scriptures were read, or any other religious duty performed, he would hollow, roar, and whiſtle, till his ſtrength ſeemed quite ſpent: Yet though ſo diſaffected to what is good, he would ask for a pack of Cards, or a Ballad; and laugh; and ſhew great rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, if any one did but mention ſuch things to him.</p>
            <p>Then he fell into furious frantick Fits. Being one time in the Field with the Mowers of Corn, on a ſudden (though ſeveral took care of him) he made and eſcape, and threw off his clothes in his flight; and they could not overtake him, till he had gotten to the other end of the field, and was crept into a narrow gutter in the Hedge, ſo that they could hardly pluck him back again.</p>
            <p>And when he was within, and the doors kept faſt, and two or three to watch him, he would run to and fro in the Houſe, leaping up and down over the Table, with very ſtrange agility of body. His eyes would commonly be at the door; which if he could at any time find un guarded, or not much regarded by the company, he would run ſwiftly to make an eſcape, which was always his great deſire. Once he ran through ſeven or eight perſons, who could not hold him: And as he was run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, he threw off all his clothes, ſhirt, and all in an inſtant.</p>
            <p>Then they bound his hands behind him with a very narrow Towel, tyed ſtrait upon his wriſts, with three knots: Yet when he pleaſed he would take out his hands, and put them in again; which would be as faſt bound, as ever they were. Thus he would leap over an high gate with his hands faſt bound be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind his back; which he once did, on an endevour to make an eſcape, being let out only to try what he would do.</p>
            <p>He did attempt to go out at a Window, the breadth between the Moulins being ſcarce three inches; yet had gotten his legs
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:35731:5"/>out, and one arm, and almoſt all his head, notwithſtanding that divers perſons preſent followed him immediately to pluck him back again, but could not, till ſome went on the out-ſide; and then (as he ſaid) the Devil left him. He could (as he affirmed) have put his body out at a Mouſe-hole; and did ſhoot himſelf into a little hole in the Wall on the ſide of a Window up to the Waſte, and further. The hole went through the Wall, in the form of a Pyramid, of no capacity in the ordinary courſe of nature to contain ſuch a body as his was.</p>
            <p>One, among many others, coming towards the houſe to ſee him, at a good diſtance in the Field met with the Boys Maſter, and gave advice to bind him, and not ſuffer that trouble with him: Who coming immediately into the Houſe, called the Boy by his name, and asked him how he did: Who looking with a furious countenance, anſwerd, Thou rogue, thou ſaidſt I ſhould be bound, didſt not? For the Boy confeſſed afterwards that the Devil told him ere the perſon came into the Houſe what he ſaid, and deſcribed him unto him.</p>
            <p>When the Devil did appear to him, (which was very often) it was however variouſly, and in divers modes: Sometimes plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly, ſhewing him rare things, and preſenting to his view the Towns and Villages within two miles compaſs round about, as plainly, as though he had been in them; ſometimes frowning and threatning him: On which the Boy was as variouſly affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and poſtured; ſometimes ſmiling, laughing, and playing with his fingers, uttering a childiſh fawning voyce; ſometimes yelling and roaring in a very hideous manner, yet in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervall was rational and ſober: Only when any Religious Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were on foot, he would ſtill hollow, roar, and whiſtle very ſhrilly; and ſo continue for a while, and then fall as if dead, and then on a ſudden he would ſtart up, and renew the ſame out cry again.</p>
            <p>Thus for about ſeven weeks his Maſter and the Family were exerciſed with a very ſore tryal in him; and knew not what elſe to do, but to betake themſelves to him, who hath Satan in a Chain, and rules him at his will. Hereupon conſulting with ſome Friends, what was now farther to be done in this their
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:35731:5"/>aſtoniſhing perplexity: Some were for making their addreſs to ſome Miniſters: Others were againſt it, arguing that they were but men the beſt of them; and others were endued with the ſame ſpirit that they were: Some anſwered, that the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters might have a double portion; and that they might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect an anſwer from Heaven rather on their Interceſſions, then others.</p>
            <p>That therefore at length was the determination. In the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance whereof, the Maſter of the Boy went to Mr. <hi>Nicholas Teag</hi> a Miniſter of his acquaintance a few miles diſtant, (with whom it was Vacation time) and declared the caſe to him, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what a ſad diſpenſation of Providence they were caſt; and with tears beſought his advice, what courſe to ſteer for delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. He was told, that as the diſeaſe was, ſo muſt be the means for remedy. That he ſhould get ſome knowing, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced, pious Chriſtians, or Miniſters, or both; and ſetting apart a day, ſeek help of God, with the Boy in the midſt of them. That this was Gods way, and ſo the ſafeſt and moſt effectual. That he ſhould take care none did thenceforth apply themſelves to <hi>Condy</hi> in the Boys behalf, for that was danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: And that he had cauſe to thank God, that he was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious to former applications in that kind, he being ignorant (as he profeſſed) of the perſon, and his ways of working.</p>
            <p>Upon this he deſired that Miniſter to bear a part in the work of ſuch a day, as was then propoſed, and reſolved on; who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing him, wiſhed him to get three more, and to carry the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs with as little noiſe as poſſible might be. Thus he returns to his Houſe, and the next day early, went to procure three Miniſters more, to meet at his Houſe on this ſad occaſion the day after. And therein he did ſpeed, and got Mr. <hi>Toms,</hi> Mr. <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,</hi> Mr. <hi>Lydſton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Teag,</hi> (who were all at leiſure for ſuch a ſervice) though not without a providence caſting one of them in his way, whom he had no acquaintance with, nor intended to engage; without whom he had not (probably) been fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed that time with his deſired number.</p>
            <p>The very Morning that the Boys Maſter was gone to procure the Miniſters, the Devil appeared, and told the Boy what his
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:35731:6"/>Maſter was gone, (though the thing was carried very ſecretly) <hi>viz.</hi> to get thither four Black Rogues, (as his ſtile was) and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to him each of them in particular, what manner of men they were that would come, giving him evident chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters of their perſons, which the Boy preſently made a recital of to thoſe about him, though he knew not theſe Miniſters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Beſides, that one of them fell in unexpectedly, when ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was deſigned, whom the Boy knew, but ſaid expreſly, He was not to come, (being indeed abſent that day from his Houſe) yet he ſpake directly of the feature and ſtature of him, who was leaſt likely to come together with the other three: But the Devil then charged him, not to hearken to any one word thoſe black Rogues ſhould ſay unto him.</p>
            <p>On the morrow Mr. <hi>Toms,</hi> Mr. <hi>Travers,</hi> Mr. <hi>Lydſton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Teag</hi> met; but met with more company there, then they thought of, and yet not without a good providence, (as it fell out after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards) by reaſon of the various reports about the buſineſs.</p>
            <p>Theſe Miniſters, when they came into the Houſe, found the Boy ſitting in a Chair, with a dreadful Viſage, looking fiercely upon them. They ſpake to him in words as ſuitable as they could, to his condition, and with much mildneſs, endeavoring to gain a little on his affections, and to engage his attenſion: But they received no other anſwer from him, ſave, thou Fool, and thou Rogue, what care I for thee, I'le fight with thee. A furious ſpirit againſt the Miniſter ſeeming to dart out at his eyes, and to flame through his whole viſage. Sometimes he fell a ſtrugling violently, to get looſe from them that held him, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting himſelf on the ledg of the Chair, as though he meant to ruſh upon the Miniſters; but was told, that they were come in the Name and Strength of God, and of his Son <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> to be employed in his Work; and that they feared not him, nor whatever power acted in him, ſo much to Gods diſhonor.</p>
            <p>While the Miniſters were whiſpering with their heads to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether at the Table, this Lad at the other end of the Room ſaid, He knew what they ſpake: And immediatly he leaped out of the Chair, and like a Tumbler jumped on the top of an high Table, and ſo down again on the in ſide, and crept un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:35731:6"/>it, roaring much like a Bull. Mr. <hi>Teag</hi> one of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters pluckt him with ſome violence thence, and ſet him in the Chair again.</p>
            <p>Then the Devil appeared to him in a Stair-Caſe, that was over againſt him in the ſame Room, all in black, like Velvet, and told him, he ſhould not hearken to thoſe Black Rogues. The Boy held up his finger. and ſmiled, making a Childiſh noiſe to it by way of anſwer, and then began to roar again; yet earneſtly looking ever and anon towards the Stair-Caſe. On this, a Woman of his intimate acquaintance asked him pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately what he ſaid, who told her as it is before related. Then ſhe ſtept directly before him, interpoſing her ſelf directly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and the Stairs, to hinder his ſight of what he fixed his eyes upon: But he raiſed himſelf up in the Chair on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, higher then her head, with his feet on the Seat of the Chair, and ſaw it again, making the ſame ſigns to it.</p>
            <p>Now Mr. <hi>Teag</hi> one of the Miniſters took a portion of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſuitable to the occaſion, and ſpake on it a while and then addreſſed himſelf, and the reſt there preſent with him, to God in prayer. In the beginning of theſe exerciſes the Boy did hout, roar, and whiſtle, but after a little while fell as dead. Then were his Arms, and other parts, one while as plyant as a Glove, and on a ſudden as ſtiff as a Stake, no bowing of them. He would ſometimes ſtart up ſuddenly, and ſtare with his eyes, hout, and roar, and whiſtle, but ſoon fell back in the Chair as dead again. A ſtrong young man held his arms all the while, and a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman (Siſter to a Juſtice of Peace, not far from thence) held his legs, kneeling before him.</p>
            <p>Thus the Miniſters went on in prayer by turn, with ſome lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle intermiſſion betwixt each of them, in which they ſpake to the Boy, and to one another, with the reſt of the company. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the middle of that days duty the Boy was very unruly, &amp; made an hideous noiſe, cauſing great diſturbance, ſo that the remaining part of that ſervice was in danger to be confounded, the voice of the Miniſter then in prayer being almoſt wholly drowned for a good while together. But Mr. <hi>Teag,</hi> one of the Miniſters removed from kneeling at the Table, and placed
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:35731:7"/>himſelf beſides the Chair, where the Boy ſate; then took he the Boy by the hand with his, as he was raving, and preſently he became ſilent, and dead, as before. After a while he took off his hand ſoftly from the Boys; which was no ſooner done, but he ſtarted up, giving a ſigh, opened his eyes, &amp; brake into out-rage, as at other times. Then Mr. <hi>Teag</hi> took hold on his hand again, &amp; immediatly the Boys ſpirits ſunk away, and he became as dead. This was done ſundry times, partly to avoid the trouble which the Miniſter found in keeping ſtill in that poſture and action of holding the Boys hand, and partly for tryal, whether it would prove alike, being often reiterated, and that ſometimes after a longer ceſſation, but ſtill the effect was the ſame; that if he withdrew his hand never ſo inſenſibly, the Boy raged forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with; but laying it on, he fell in an inſtant, and lay in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance as dead as a ſtock: Only now and then the Miniſter felt at his Wriſt a ſudden vibration and quivering of the ſpirits with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, but no part moved outwardly. So after full tryal this Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter kept on his hand, till the duties of the day were concluded. That which gave the firſt occaſion and motive to this courſe, was an obſervation made in the morning, upon the Miniſters firſt entring diſcourſe with the Boy, that his enmity to them was ſuch, as he would not endure any of their hands ſhould touch his, but declined it with much vehemence; and if they caught hold of him unavoidably, he fell in a dead fit; <hi>but not ſo, when others d d take him by the hand:</hi> Which occaſioned that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of ſome afterwards, that in this the Devil was <hi>out-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;</hi> though indeed there was a ſpecial Providence ſo ordering &amp; directing it at that time, as is for good reaſon acknowledged by the moſt concerned in that particular. Yet towards the cloſe of that days work, about a quarter of an hour before the end, the Devil told the Boy (as he fince affirms) while he lay in his dead Fit, that if he would look the other way, and not in the Miniſters face, he ſhould open his eyes, and roar, &amp; diſturb them again, notwithſtanding the Miniſters hand which held his; which he began to do, with mighty ſtrugling, his face being turned away directly from the Miniſters even into the boſome of the man that held him on the other ſide of the Chair. Mr.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:35731:7"/>
               <hi>Teag</hi> the Miniſter did not perceive this at firſt (his thoughts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing otherwiſe exerciſed) nor indeed, when he looked up at the noiſe did he underſtand the meaning of it, nor what more to do; ſo that the Boy made a little diſturbance, but it ſo fell out, that Mr. <hi>Teag</hi> raiſed himſelf a little ſomewhat higher on his knees, and ſtretching over, looked the Boy in the face, and rebuked him, whereupon he preſently fell dead, but within little that Mr. <hi>Teag</hi> the Miniſter was returned to his former poſture, and had with-drawn his head, the Boy was up again, beginning to hollow again aloud and again ſunk dead on his looking over upon him. But Mr. <hi>Teag</hi> the Miniſter did not remove to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide of the Chair, to look ſtedfaſtly and conſtantly in his face; ſo that theſe changes in him were ſundry times repeated in that ſhort ſpace, till Prayer was ended.</p>
            <p>When the duty was over, and the day ſpent, the Boy was not much altered; yet was thought ſomewhat better, in that he went up and down the Houſe very quiet, and walked forth into the entry, and did not eſſay to run away. But ſtill the Miniſters had no other language from him then before. And he ſaid, their words were ugly words. Only he uttered it more calmly and modeſtly, as though he had been aſhamed.</p>
            <p>Thus they departed, commending the Family and company to the Grace of God, deſiring the Lord to make ſome return to their prayers, and to remember that poor creature in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, &amp;c. leaving ſome charge concerning him that night.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as they were gone, the Boy deſired to go to Bed, where he no ſooner was, but he fell into a dead ſleep, (as was thought) and ſo lay till the next morning. Three perſons did watch by him that night, who heard a noiſe, as of horſes run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning furiouſly into the Court, the doors unlatched and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lockt, ſo that they were in a very great fear. The ne t morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Boy roſe ſomewhat early, and told his Maſter, he would go into the Field to the Harveſt work, whither he went, but being come thither, he fell into his roaring fits, making a great noiſe, ſo they bound him, and laid him down, and went a little diſtance from him to their work.</p>
            <p>The Boy, though his hands were bound behind him, and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:35731:8"/>his legs faſtened together, yet would leap upright upon his feet, and move forward leaping, and then fall down again, &amp; move on his ſide towards the hedg. This drew his Maſter and all the people about him, who brought him back to the place where they had left him. And after they had dealt ſeriouſly with him a little while, they returned to their work again, leaving him bound; but he began to make toward the hedg as before. On which they all came about him again, &amp; ſate down with him.</p>
            <p>And whereas no perſwaſion or means could bend his obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy through the whole courſe of theſe his extravagancies to make any mention of God, or ſhew himſelf active and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in any duty of Religion, they now found upon their ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging him that way (though it had often been done before) ſome paſſionate relent and meltings in him.</p>
            <p>Then ſome that were by, put him upon repeating the Lords Prayer, as that which they judged moſt familiar to him. Having rehearſed theſe words, he began to make ſome noiſe, and falling backwards, cried out, <hi>He is gone, He is gone.</hi> His Maſter asked what? The Boy ſaid the Devil, that hath troubled me all this while. Then he preſently enquired for Mr. <hi>Teag</hi> the Miniſters, that had prayed for him the day before, and would be carried to them. This was obſerved to fall out about the ſame hour that the Miniſters fell to work the day fore-going.</p>
            <p>Then they took up the Boy, and carried him into the Houſe. For he that juſt before could leap, and do ſuch ſtrange feats of Activity, now could not ſtand alone, nor had ſtrength to feed himſelf, but was ſed on a Womans knees as a child. His ſpirits and voice were very low, and his body exceeding ſore all over.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as he had recovered ſo much ſtrength of nature, as to be able to utter ſo many words with an audible voice (which was about a week after.) He confeſſed not only what hath been already mentioned, which he farther confirmed, but moreover, as followeth.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That towards the end of the day of ſeeking God, when Mr. <hi>Teag</hi> the laſt of the Miniſters was drawing to a cloſe, he felt ſomewhat within him creeping up towards his Throat like a living creature, &amp; ſtriving (as it ſeemed to him) to force its paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:35731:8"/>out at his mouth, which cauſed a great commotion in him, and exceedingly afflicted him with torture in his body. And he was farther told by that which ſo vexed him, that he ſhould be tormented yet worſe, if that black Rogue did not leave praying the ſooner. And he verily thought that if the duty had conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued a while longer, ſome ſtrange effect had followed on the place, and the Devil had then gone out of him. This was about the time, when he was bid turn away his face from Mr. <hi>Teag</hi> the Miniſter who held his hand (as was mentioned before) that he might make farther diſturbance.</item>
               <item>2. That the night after the Miniſters went away, though he went to Bed, and ſeemed aſleep, yet he was not aſleep all that night, but ſaw all the Chamber, and all the World (as he thought) in a flame about him. And once that night the Devil came to the top of the ſtairs, and holding up his fiſt, did grin at him, threatning him that if he had him in his power, he would tear him in a thouſand pieces.</item>
               <item>3. That what went out of his Mouth in the Field next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when he ſaid, he is gone, he is gone, was like a Rat, and went into a Fire, which did appear near the hedg of that Field in a Ditch, towards which he was moving, when left bound as before, and that the fire did aſcend into the Air, and the Rat in it, and he ſaw it paſs over to Saint <hi>Germans</hi> Town two miles from thence.</item>
               <item>4. That this Field, and that very part of it, where the Fire appeared, was the place appointed before for meeting. The time then very neer approaching, being on the Lords Day in the Afternoon next following (which was termed in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract the Ugly Day) when and where he was to have received money enough, and gone away with the Devil: From whom God hath now graciouſly and mercifully delivered him.</item>
            </list>
            <p>After the noiſe of this ſtupendious Providence was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what over (for much diſcourſe there was about it. Some ſaid, It was the Fanaticks work. Others that 'twas a Presbyterian Juggle, but the more ſober and wiſer ſort, and thoſe in power, after narrow ſcrutiny, did acknowledg themſelves fully ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and openly confeſſed <hi>Digitus Dei eſt hic</hi>) the Miniſters met
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:35731:9"/>in the ſame place with the ſame company to return praiſe to God, where the Boy was alſo preſent in his former ſoundneſs of mind, and freedom from that power, which had ſo cruelly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted him. Yet was he ſtill under much faintneſs and debility of ſpirits. And there did he Ioyn in that Days ſervice, demean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf ſoberly and modeſtly, affectionately acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gods mercy in his great deliverance (ſeeing the very next Lords Day after was like to have proved ſo critical and fatal to him) and applying himſelf to the Miniſters, gave them all great thanks for their great care and pains.</p>
            <p>Since that he hath recovered bodily ſtrength and livelineſs, and his Maſter keeps him to School. The Lord power his Spirit on him, and purge him, that he may be a Veſſel of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, who hath been as a brand pluckt out of the Fire.</p>
            <p>The Boy can go in the dark into the Chamber, where he lay under this dreadfull Viſitation, and walk abroad without fear.</p>
